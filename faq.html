          <h2>About</h2>				  				  
          <p>Every two years, the Washington state legislature adopts a budget based on the amount of revenue it receives from sales, property, business, and other taxes like those on liquor and tobacco. Those funds are then spent on public schools and universities, hospitals, prisons, courts, health care, and other critical state services.</p>                  
          <p>This visualization opens up Washington’s budget for everyone – so it is easy to see how much is spent, on what, and how it compares to previous years. The charts display “Real” data, which are adjusted for inflation, alongside “Nominal” data, which are not. In this way, it is easy to compare real year-over-year expenditures on budget items as broad as Public Education, and as specific as the Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p>
          <h2 id="q1">What is the Near General Fund - State?</h2>				  				  <p>Washington's Near General Fund - State, commonly abbreviated NGFS, inlcudes these funds and accounts:</p>					<p>						<ul>							<li>Equal Justice Subaccount</li>							<li>Education Legacy Trust Account</li>							<li>Health Services Account</li>							<li>Pension Funding Stabilization Account</li>							<li>Public Safety and Education Account</li>							<li>Student Achievement Fund</li>							<li>Violence Reduction and Drug Enforcement Account</li>							<li>Water Quality Account</li>						</ul>					</p>				  <p>Amounts prior to FY2012 were updated January 2013; the 2011-13 amounts reflect the Enacted budgets from the 2012 legislative session.</p>

          <h2 id="q2">What is excluded from the NGFS?</h2>				  				  <p>The data shown here reflects Washington state’s operating expenses; the state legislature adopts separate budgets for transportation (using the gas tax and other dedicated revenue) and capital projects.</p>				  				  				  <h2 id="q3">More questions?</h2>				  				  <p>Please <a href="http://stateofworkingwa.org/contact.htm">contact us</a>.				  				  <p class="mute right">                    Based on <a href='http://lookatcook.com'>Look at Cook</a> by <a href='http://derekeder.com'>Derek Eder</a> or <a href='http://c82.net'>Nick Rougeux</a> at <a href='http://opencityapps.org'>Open City</a>.
